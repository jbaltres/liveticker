# Eventlistener

The Eventlistener gives an overview, on current and future drinks and food happy hours/ specials in a city.
It bundles the information in this app.
On the other hand, bar owners can create Events spontanously.
Therefore they can easily create an event with the given forms.

_This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)._

```

### `npm run storybook`

### `json-server --watch db.json --port 3001`

starts the fake Api on port 3001 to communicate with the data.
